Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The drivers pass project was a project that was based around a client who wanted to create a system that would help individuals who wanted to pass their drivers test becuase of the overwhelming percentage of people failing their drivers test. They wanted to offer packages that can be purchased by the users. They wanted them to be able to have access to a instrustor and have the abliity to see their progress as a student. They wanted the system to be able to be access from any device that had the ability to use the internet and a internet browser for users, admins and for the owner. 
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I feel like I did well with going in the depth about the project and the systems needs to be able to fuction to the clients wants and needs. 
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would not reivse anything i am happy with the work that I have done for this course and this assignment.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I would dive into this view of I am a user and what would I want and need as a user to better understand what all the system should be able to do and provide to us as the user. I think doing that helped me think about     things out side of the box and outside of what was given to us in the interview document. 
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  Fristly establishing that it is going to be web based and cloud based was the start. Allowing the ability to have regular updates to not only the system but for the security as well to be able to keep the program reliable. 
  focusing on the core wants and needs of the client then adding my own personal opinion on what the program needs and should do also helped me with the design and development process.
